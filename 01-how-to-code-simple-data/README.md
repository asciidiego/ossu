# How to Code: Simple Data

This folder contains all the exercises of the How To Code Simple Data course.
These are Racket files. Most of them are not human readable unless opened with
Dr Racket. That is because of the way DrRacket encodes comment boxes among
other useful UI elements when programming in the Beginner's Student Language.

## Semi-automatic commit

This command stages a Racket file in the following format `XX-myfile.rkt` to the git repository.
But, it only works with `oh-my-zsh`.

```bash
source source-me.sh
```
